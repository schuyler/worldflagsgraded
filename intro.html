Some time ago, browsing through my friend's atlas, I realised that
there are significant differences in quality between the flags of
different countries.  Some are good, some are bad.  Some countries
have clearly taken care in the choice of colours, layout, and design.
Others have been lazy, stolen the flags of their neighbours, or just
designed flags that are clearly supposed to cause pain to those who
look at them.
</p>

<p>
To my surprise, there is no international body responsible for
upholding simple standards of vexillilic aesthetics.  Nor do the UN or
Interpol have the power to call in and punish those responsible for
such atrocities as the Brazilian or Cypriot flags.  I suppose there is
probably a conspiracy of rich western nations (those with permanent
seats on the UN security council, no doubt) to prevent such crimes
from being brought to justice; however, in the meantime I am giving
letter grades to the existing flags of the world.

You can read about the <a href=meth.html>methodology</a> I used.
You can read the results <a href=alpha.html>alphabetically, by country
name</a>, or <a href=ratings.html>by grade</a>, or broken down by
grade:
<ul> 
<li><a href=ratings-a.html>A grades</a>,
<li><a href=ratings-b.html>B grades</a>,
<li><a href=ratings-c.html>C grades</a>,
<li><a href=ratings-d.html>failing grades</a>.
</ul>
