<h2>The world's flags given letter grades</h2>
<h1>Methodology</h1>
</div>
<table width=100% cellpadding=6 cellspacing=0 border=0>

<h3>1. Flag Grades</h3>
<p>
Each flag's final mark is based on my judgement of the flag's overall
aesthetic value.  I initially assigned letter grades, then numeric
grades to reflect each flag's position within its grade.

The letter grades range from A+ to D-, and F.  There are distinct C-,
and D+, D- grades.  Anything lower than a C- is a fail: that country
would be better off without a flag at all.  The highest failing
numeric grade is fixed at 49%.
</p>

<p>
I assigned the letter grades in the way I usually mark student papers.
C would be assigned to flags that were just satisfactory, but
seriously flawed in some way; B to strong attempts with minor flaws;
and A to inspired or advanced work.  I calibrated this scale by
choosing some paradigm examples of flags whose grades I was, at the
outset, very sure of:
</p>

<p>
To recieve an F, a flag had to be so awful that its level of badness
was clearly qualitatively different from that of any flag receiving a
D.  I had to feel that a country receiving an F had really set out to
create a genuinely horrible flag, or didn't really know what a flag
was.  One prominent vexillologist I consulted put it thus: "Some
countries' flags look like tea towels.  If you'd rather be using the
flag as a tea towel, and your tea towel as the flag, give it an F."
</p>

<p>
In the end, only three countries received such a distinction, all
U.S. territories (hence my suspicions about the US using its security
council veto to block the bringing of bad flag designers to justice).
Of these, I wouldn't even trust the <a href=alpha.html#mp>Northern
Mariana Islands</a> flag to clean my cutlery - it's probably not
colourfast.
</p>

<h3>2. Criteria</h3>

<p>
After a quick survey of outstandingly good and bad flags, I was able
to come up with some basic rules or advice to countries designing
flags.
</p>

<h4>Rule 1: <i>Do not write the name of your country on your flag.</i></h4>

<p>
This just seemed obvious to me.  Nevertheless, there are some
countries that will flout it (like <a href=alpha.html#gu>Guam</a>),
and they need to be severely punished.  Perhaps they think that their
citizens might forget the name of their country.  
</p>

<p>
This rule turns out to be difficult to police because of the silly
things that countries like <a href=alpha.html#rw>Rwanda</a> and the <a href=alpha.html#vi>U.S. Virgin Islands</a> will do to
get around it.  And there a deeper problem of unoriginality here.
It's just wrong to have writing on your flag.  It subverts the ideals
of flag design.  Hence:
</p>

<h4>Rule 1a: <i>Do not write on your flag.</i></h4>

<p>
I also felt that I ought to pick out some types of written things on
flags for special punishment, besides the name of the country.
</p>

<h4>Rule 1b: <i>Do not write some stupid slogan on your flag.</i></h4>

<p>
British colonies and former colonies love putting widdly little coats
of arms on their flags with Latin slogans like 'et cetera' and
'Caecilius est in horto' on them (e.g. <a href=alpha.html#ky>Cayman Islands</a>, <a href=alpha.html#vg>British Virgin Islands</a>).  This is because
junior civil servants in the Crown Office of Naming Other People's
Countries want to show off how valuable their Etonian education is.
</p>

<p>
Even this is not the worst.  Some British civil servants do not even
have an Etonian education.  Thus:
</p>

<h4>Rule 1c: <i>If you must write a stupid slogan on your flag, do not do so in a living language!</i></h4>

<p>
Violations of rule 1c leads to horrors such as the flag of the <a href=alpha.html#fk>Falkland Islands</a>.  <a href=alpha.html#br>Brazil</a> also deserve mention for awfulness in this regard (though I cannot begin to do justice to the badness of their flag at this early stage).
</p>

<h4>Rule 2: <i>Do not put a map of your country on your flag.</i></h4>

<p>
When someone is travelling around your country, where do you think
they will look if they need a map?
</p>

<p>
Bzzt! No, they won't look at the flag.  Especially not if it has such
a bad colour scheme as <a href=alpha.html#cy>Cyprus</a>'s.  Quite
apart from the total uselessness of having a map on your flag, it
really shows that a country hasn't gone to any effort if that's the
best they can think of.  I mean, if we just let people put maps on
their flags, everyone could do that, and then there wouldn't be any
need for any design effort to go into flags.
</p>

<p>
Actually, to generalise this rule a little, you can't just put
pictures of things on flags.  It looks wrong.  Flags are supposed to
be iconic.  They're a shrine to the national spirit, not a tourist
brochure.  Accordingly:
</p>

<h4>Rule 2a: <i>Do not put a picture of anything on your flag.</i></h4>

<p>
That's right: no pictures.  Especially not of sheep (are you listening, <a href=alpha.html#fk>Falkland Islands</a>?) or parrots (this means you, <a href=alpha.html#dm>Dominica</a>!).  Stylised logos <i>based on</i> representations are OK (<a href=alpha.html#al>Albania</a> is pushing it) but representational art is out.
</p>

<h4>Rule 3: <i>Do not use a tricolour unless you are in Europe.</i></h4>

<p>
Actually there is no excuse for any country to use a tricolour - but
some places (e.g. <a href=alpha.html#fr>France</a>, <a href=alpha.html#it>Italy</a>) are stuck with them and couldn't really
change now.  The real problem with tricolours is not that they are bad
flags - some are quite good - it's just that they are a hang over from
a time when fewer countries had flags and tricolour space wasn't so
crowded.  These days no-one should be using a tricolour if they can
avoid it.  It's not that tricolours are bad <i>per se</i>; people
should just know better than to start using one after say, 1900.
</p>

<p>
Africa is particularly full of awful tricolours.  What makes them
particularly bad is that they are all the same colours: that red
yellow green thing.  Why aren't countries just embarrassed by the fact
that their flag is the same as their neighbours, except backwards,
upside down, or with a big green star on it?  <a
href=alpha.html#rw>Rwanda</a> deserves special mention for
unbelievable unoriginality in this field.
</p>

<p>
Eastern Europe is also a bad case.  Many of the states there had a
chance to change their flags when they were all busy seceding from
each other, and the best they could do was go back to these horrible
tricolours.  Probably the reason their neighbours annexed them in the
first place was that they couldn't stand to see such vomitous colours
just over the border in <a href=alpha.html#am>Armenia</a>, <a
href=alpha.html#lt>Lithuania</a>, or <a
href=alpha.html#bg>Bulgaria</a>.
</p>

<h3>3. Special Codes</h3>

<p>
As well as assigning letter grades, I also assigned each flag a set of
codes corresponding to common failings, or particularly good
understanding of what it takes to make a good flag.  These are listed below:
</p>

<table align=center>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/gi.gif width=32 height=34 border=0><br>Graven Images</font></td>
<td>
Violations of rule 2a.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/e1.gif width=32 height=25 border=0><br>Eyewatering</font></td>
<td>
This flag caused my eyes to water.  Often in virtue of a particularly
bad combination of colours, though the most notably eyewatering flags,
those of <a href=alpha.html#gl>Greenland</a> and <a href=alpha.html#gr>Greece</a>, manage to achieve their effect with only two
colours.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/v1.gif width=48 height=48 border=0><br>Makes me nauseous</font></td>
<td>
This flag caused me to feel like vomiting (or in some cases, to
vomit).  Again, often caused by bad colours.  Though perhaps Paul's
apricot, chocolate and coconut biscuits were to blame.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/1w.gif width=29 height=29 border=0><br>Writing!</font></td>
<td>
Don't write on the flag!  Violations of rule 1a.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/cn.gif width=70 height=48 border=0><br>Colonial Nonsense</font></td>
<td>
Used for countries that have the flags of their colonial masters as a
part of their flag.  The colonial master in question is nearly always
the UK, but that's just because French territories all use the French
flag, and US external territories all use something the local military
commander has created using Microsoft Frontpage.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/cl.gif width=32 height=34 border=0><br>Corporate Logo</font></td>
<td>
This flag looks like a corporate logo.  Many attempts at "modern"
looking flags fall into this trap, notably <a href=alpha.html#lc>Saint Lucia</a>, which induced in me a
strange desire to seek financial advice from the inhabitants of this
fledgling Caribbean nation.  Probably this is counterproductive, as
they are mostly employed in the <a href=http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/st.html#Econ>corrugated cardboard box assembly industry</a>.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/1m.gif width=32 height=32 border=0><br>Maps!</font></td>
<td>
Don't put a map on the flag!  Violations of rule 2.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/bs.gif width=48 height=36 border=0><br>Bad Shape</font></td>
<td>
The safest shape for a flag is a golden rectangle.  Some people can
get away with a 2:1 rectangle (it doesn't make the <a href=alpha.html#nz>New Zealand</a> flag any worse than
it would be otherwise, for example) but others can't, especially when
the flag has horizontal stripes on it (like <a href=alpha.html#yu>Yugoslavia</a>'s, for example).
I've used this code when country's departure from the golden rectangle
formula makes their flag worse, or when they are just being silly (like <a href=alpha.html#np>Nepal</a>)
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/gs.gif width=30 height=23 border=0><br>Good Shape</font></td>
<td>
Occasionally, a flag is improved by being not a golden rectangle.  Very occasionally.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/bc.gif width=64 height=37 border=0><br>Bad Colours</font></td>
<td>
Used either if a flag's colours are just intrinsically ugly (like <a href=alpha.html#ge>Georgia</a>'s), or if they clash horribly (like <a href=alpha.html#nu>Niue</a>'s).
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/gc.gif width=64 height=37 border=0><br>Good Colours</font></td>
<td>
Used where a country has made a particularly good choice of colours -
either original or aesthetically pleasing - for their flag.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/hc.gif width=64 height=37 border=0><br>Hideous Colours</font></td>
<td>
I quickly found that by handing out "Bad Colours" every time a flag
contained colours that fell short of reasonable standards, I had
deflated its meaning so that it could no longer fully express the
horror and sickness I felt in seeing flags such as that of <a href=alpha.html#aw>Aruba</a>.
Accordingly, where a flag's designers appear to have been entirely
colourblind <i>and</i> filled with anger and hatred towards those of
us able to see the colours of their flag, I have awarded this code.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/tb.gif width=32 height=32 border=0><br>Too busy</font></td>
<td>
Flags should have simple, iconic designs.  I have marked flags with
this code where they conspicuously fall short of that goal.  There are
many different ways in which this can happen.  One is where countries
get involved in drawing fiddily little pictures on their flag, in
violation of rule 2a.  The other is the kind of "more is better"
mentality best typified by <a href=alpha.html#mu>Mauritius</a> and <a href=alpha.html#cf>Central African Republic</a>.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/s.gif width=32 height=32 border=0><br>Simple</font></td>
<td>
Awarded for simple but effective designs.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/1o.gif width=20 height=27 border=0><br>Plagiarism</font></td>
<td>
Awarded to flags that are obviously stolen from someone else, (and
added a big R in the middle - I am not fooled, <a href=alpha.html#rw>Rwanda</a>).  I'm not sure
whether it's worse to just have basically the same flag as your
neighbours (<a href=alpha.html#ec>Ecuador</a> and <a href=alpha.html#co>Colombia</a>) or to rip off someone from across the world and try to hide the fact by changing the colours (<a href=alpha.html#nf>Norfolk Island</a>'s clever, ah, paraphrase, of <a href=alpha.html#ca>Canada</a>'s flag).
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/o.gif width=20 height=27 border=0><br>Original</font></td>
<td>
Extra points for originality.  Not always a good thing.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/11.gif width=58 height=50 border=0><br>Weapons</font></td>
<td>
If you are going to put a picture on your flag (in violation of rule
2a) why would you put pictures of the weapons that you are using to
conduct a bloody repression of your citizens on it?  This just doesn't
make sense to me.  Obviously countries like <a href=alpha.html#af>Afghanistan</a> and <a href=alpha.html#mz>Mozambique</a> just aren't
interested in the tourist dollars that you can get from not
advertising the fact that you like to hack off the limbs of foreigners
before shooting them and turning them into soap.  Still, it's their loss.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/mc.gif width=48 height=32 border=0><br>Bad Tricolour</font></td>
<td>
Violations of rule 3.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=sans-serif size=-1><img src=icons/ms.gif width=40 height=42 border=0><br>Too many stars</font></td>
<td>
Everyone loves stars.  Even me.  That's why <a href=alpha.html#vn>Viet Nam</a> gets such a high
grade.  Some people, however, are under the mistaken impression that
if one star is good, then fifty must be just right.  I'm not sure if
its worse if the stars are all just piled together, as on the <a href=alpha.html#us>United States</a>
flag, or if they are are supposed to be in some special arrangement
(as in <a href=alpha.html#tv>Tuvalu</a> and <a href=alpha.html#au>Australia</a>).

<h3>4. Resources</h3>

<p>
I made the initial gradings using the 
<a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/081293265X/qid=988340744/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_2/107-5896762-4383760>Times Atlas of the World</a>.  
For the online version of the gradings, I used the flags from <a href=http://www.fotw.net/flags/>Flags of the World</a>, a fine internet resource that I heartily recommend.  The <a href=http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/>CIA world factbook</a> was also helpful, though the CIA, as well as installing bugging devices in my teeth, use their own two letter country codes instead of <a href=http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/>ISO3166-1</a>, thereby making their site less useful than it might be.
