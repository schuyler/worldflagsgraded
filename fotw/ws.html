<P>Samoa adopted a flag like today on 26 May 1948, but only with four stars (like New Zealand). The fifth star was added on 24 February 1949. In 1962 Samoa gained its independence.

<P>Flag: The Flag has a red field with a blue canton in the upper left- hand corner. Five white stars on the canton symbolize the Southern Cross constellation. The red, white, and blue colours stand for loyalty,  purity, and patriotism. Adopted in 1962.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The West Samoan flag was adopted 24 February 1949, when the previous design with only four stars was modified. The previous design was adopted 26 May 1948. 1962 was the year of independence under the diarchy (1963 monarchy).<BR>

<P>The lower star of the Southern Cross must be larger than the three main stars of the Cross (<A HREF="bib-pa.html#pay">Album des Pavillons</A>, <A HREF="bib-u.html#udk">DK Ultimate Pocket</A>, Pedersen). But all of the four stars have the same size in Smith (<A HREF="bib-sa.html#smi75b">1975</A> & <A HREF="bib-sa.html#smi80">1980</A>) and "<A HREF="bib-b.html#brt96">Flags of Paradise</A>" chart. The upper and lower stars must be linked by an imaginary line parallel to the flag hoist (all above sources).<BR>

<P>Neither the 1995 Whitaker's Almanac nor the 1997 CIA Factbook on the Internet show this change. However, Samoa has a strange constitution where upon independence there was a dual monarchy of two traditional chiefs. One of the chiefs died in 1963 and the other continued as the sole monarch. However, when he dies, the constitution provides that  Samoa will become a republic, with the head of state elected for a five-year term by the legislative assembly. It is likely that this recently happened and a formal change of name was passed to reflect the event. I do not suppose the flag will have changed and I have never heard of a specific flag for the head of state of Samoa.

<P>There was a recent news item relevant to this. The legislature in American Samoa passed a bill that says the territory does not object to the use of the title &quot;Samoa&quot; by Western Samoa.

<P>Other Samoan facts (from Encyclopaedia Universalis Factbook &quot;Les Chiffres du Monde&quot;, 1998) Country name: Independent State of Samoa (formerly Independent State of Western Samoa) - Malo Sa'oloto Tuto'atasi o Samoa (formerly Malolotuto'atasi o Samoa i Sisifo) - Short form: Samoa (formerly Western Samoa - but digraph WS is still in use). In July 1997, the legislative Assembly approved the suppression of &quot;Western&quot; in the country name. The country will be officially &quot;Samoa&quot; as soon as the Head of the state sign the amendment. As reported by Roy Stilling, the state will become a Republic after the death of the present head, Malieotea Tanumafila II, whose official title is: O le Ao o le Malo.



<P>Flag (from Smith, 1975) The XIXth century independent kingdom of Samoa had several flags in which red and white were predominant. The colors were not used after 1900 when German and American colonial rules were established. They
reappeared officially, however, in the Western Samoa flag hoisted in 1948. That design - to which a further star was added the next year - was created by Their Highnesses Tupua Tamasese Mea'ole and Malietoa Tanumafili II. Until 1962 when independence was achieved under United Nations trusteeship, Western Samoa flew the flag of New Zealand at sea and , jointly with its own flag, on land. Today (Western) Samoa's sole official flag is honored in the national anthem, "Banner of Freedom". Its colors are generally associated with courage (red), purity (white), and freedom (blue).<BR>

<P>Western Samoa (islands of Savai'i, Upolu, Manono and Apolima, of which consisted before the kingdoms of Tuiaana and Malietoa) was administered by Germany from 1899 to 1920, and then by New Zealand untill independence in 1962. According to Crampton's <A HREF="bib-cr.html#cra90">TWOF</A> 1990, this was "the basic flag of the Malietoa kingdom" ... "prior to 1900" ... "probably inspired by missionaries" while the Tuiaana line, who favored the German cause, used flags with black crosses.<BR>

<P>Another flag here from the William Crampton book <A HREF="bib-cr.html#cra89">The Complete Guide to Flags</A> (c)1989.  This one was under the Western Samoa section of the book, on page 127.</P>

<P>Tupua Tamasesse (1887-1889).  The flag is white with a black St. George's cross  throughout, and a white star in a red canton.</P>

I found that the dates for this flag fit roughly between the two time periods for the Kingdom of Samoa (1873-1886 and 1888-1900). <BR>

<P>The "<A HREF="bib-b.html#brt96">Flags of Paradise</A>" chart shows an older flag: a red field with a white crescent and a white 5-pointed star pointing upwards. It is labelled "Samoa 1858-1873".

<P>I find this flag rather strange. It is the only of the several flags of the chart to have a cresecent, and I cannot imagine a Moslim influence in Samoa (which was under "control" of Protestant missions and Germans).<BR>
